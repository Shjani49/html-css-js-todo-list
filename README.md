# html-css-js-todo-list
The assignment is to create a To-Do list using HTML, CSS and Javascript.

Mandatory Requirements:
* Please make a "To-Do" JavaScript program that can handle:
* Adding new to-do items to an “Active To-Dos” list.
* Completing to-dos by checking a checkbox, or by clicking on the to-do item which then adds the item to a separate "Completed To-Dos" list with the checkbox checked and disabled, and removes the item from the “Active To-Dos” list.
* The HTML for the page must be semantic.

Challenge Goals:
* Student has added a unique/unanticipated feature
* Student has added timestamps
* Student has added delete feature
* Student has added edit feature, and if timestamps are added, a last edited time is present
* Student has added an additional column and adjusted timestamp behaviour so that start timestamp is added when the item is moved to the Active list, not when the item is created.
* Student has added some nice CSS and HTML

Super Challenge Goal:

* Student has added field to the form for collecting estimates
* Estimates are rounded to the nearest 0.25 hour
* Estimates are compared to the actual time taken to complete a task and the results are presented and fully explained to the user.
